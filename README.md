# DeepSAR Python Package

A Python package implementing a hybrid framework that combines physical modeling with data-driven techniques to correct DEM penetration bias in TanDEM-X InSAR data. This package is the official implementation of the methodology described in our paper "Hybrid Physical-ML Framework for Correcting DEM Penetration Bias in TanDEM-X Data over Greenland" (2024) and "Hybrid AIâ€“Physical Modeling for Penetration Bias Correction in X-band InSAR DEMs: A Greenland Case Study" (2025).

## Key Features

- Implementation of hybrid physical-ML models for DEM penetration bias correction
- Support for different vertical scattering models (Exponential, Weibull)
- Tools for handling TanDEM-X InSAR data
- Evaluation framework for different training scenarios (Full, Interpolation, Extrapolation)
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
